# Developer's macOS Fresh Install

This document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBook ðŸ–¥

## Finder Preferences

* General > New Finder windows show > Downloads folder
* Sidebar > Show these items in the sidebar > Airdrop, Applications, Desktop, Downloads & home directory
* Advanced > Show all filename extensions
* Show View Options > Group By: Name & Sort By: Name

## Chrome DevTools Preferences

* Settings > Preferences > Network > Disable cache (while DevTools is open)
* Settings > Preferences > Appearance > Theme: Dark

## Dotfiles

* [`~/.zshrc`](./.zshrc)
* [`~/.gitconfig`](./.gitconfig)
* [`~/.gitignore`](./.gitignore) (ignore OS/IDE-specific files globally)

## SSH Keys

Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent` and store your passphrase in the keychain:

```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

To have MacOS remember your passphrase, create a new file `~/.ssh/config` and enable the `UseKeychain` option:

```
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
```
